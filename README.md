### Made in Angular 9
This project is primarily used to showcase the projects that I have worked on throughout my career as a software developer.

### Installation
You can run the command `ng serve --configuration hmr` from the root via the command line to start the Angular project with "Hot Module Replacement" (HMR) on.

### Deployment
This uses a quick deployment to Github Pages considering it's just a front-end with no underlying backend requirement. Deploy the application using the command line `ng deploy --base-href=/website/`

### TO DO
- Responsiveness
- Documentation
- Add more "`Code Adventure`" projects
